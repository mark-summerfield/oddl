# oddl

_Pre-alpha software, work in progress!_

_Prior to version 1.0.0 the API is completely unstable._

A pure Python library for loading, editing, and saving
[OpenDDL](http://openddl.org/) format files. The library can also be used as
a command line tool to check (lint), minimize (remove redundant whitespace)
and pretty (insert whitespace where needed to make it human-readable)
OpenDLL (`.oddl`) files.

The only dependencies are Python's standard library.

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/oddl/

```
python3 -m pip install oddl
